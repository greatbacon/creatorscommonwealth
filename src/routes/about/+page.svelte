            Achillea Studios is the creative project of Courtney Allen. Courtney is based in Denver, where she lives with her partner <a href="https://12mod12.com">Hamilton</a>, her dog Yarrow and her cat Brinkley. 
            She is currently working on her masters in counseling and spends the rest of her time 
            in her sewing room, at the ceramic studio, on trails with Yarrow or catching up with friends and family.

            Courtney has always been drawn to creative projects and pursuits, and got into sewing clothes during the pandemic. 
            When friends started having babies, she figured it was a good time to learn how to quilt. 
            When she was laid off from her tech job in May of 2024, she found herself with so much more time to tackle creative projects. 
            Today, Courtney finds the process of cutting, piecing and sewing quilt blocks extremely meditative, 
            and the act of creating something bold and bright for a friend or loved one to be a true gift of love and labor.
