            Creators Commonwealth is a creative collective founded in sunny Denver, Colorado that is experimenting with how we fund and build our culture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The collective is structured on a <a href="https://12mod12.com/blog/2">peer production</a> model that balances compensation between those who design
            and kickstart new things with those responsible for the actual manufacturing and fabrication of things.             
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal ultimately being to prevent the eternal IP monopolies
            that have formed in the early 21st century and to ensure the profits go to
            the people actually making the things we buy. Oh, and make some cool shit along the way.
